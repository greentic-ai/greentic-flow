# Vision Docs

`greentic-flow` documentation is now split into:

- Canonical v0.6 authoring guidance: `docs/vision/v0_6.md`
- Legacy compatibility/deprecation inventory: `docs/vision/legacy.md`
- Codex implementation rules: `docs/vision/codex.md`

Use canonical docs for all new work. Use the legacy page only when maintaining older flows/components during migration.
